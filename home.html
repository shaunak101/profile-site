                Hi, my name is Shaunak Mohapatra! At the time of creating this I am 14 years old.
                I love to program and play sports / video games. Currently I am interested to learn
                about full stack web development but I have an interest to move into Artificial intelegence
                and Blockchain in the future. I have participated in BT young scientist as well as intel mini
                scientist when I was attending primary school and my project was based on IOT automation. I
                have been learning to code for a while as I started numerous years ago by attending small
                camps known as coder dojo.

            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This website was created as the capstone project in app-academy open. I chose to make a profile
                site for my capstone project. This site has 4 pages so far. The first page is general information
                the second page contails details in order to contact me. The third page contains the steps that I
                am willing to take on my learning journey and it provides links to all of the resources. The final
                page contains links to all of my projects and their github repositories. I do have future plans of
                expanding this site at a later date but I will outline that later.
            </p>

            <h2>This Websites Future</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                As outlined above, I created this website as a project for app academy open. However, I plan on using
                this website as a profile site in the long run. In the future, I have numerous add-ons that I have planned
                such as animations and adding javascript ect but for the time being this this the site. I also plan on having
                a fifth page for notes but again this still will take time to make.
